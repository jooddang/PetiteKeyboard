# PetiteKeyboard
It's a small-sized keyboard for iPhone6+. 
This code is written for my need to type in one hand. The keyboard layout of iPhone6+ is too big for me to hold and touch in one hand. I drew a narrow keyboard layout so that I can touch all keys with my right hand.

# To-dos
  * Flip keyboard layout for left hand.
  * Recognize swipe gesture to type.
  * Enable Korean and other Unicode typing.
  * Predict words by data.
